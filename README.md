# Phitron Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Phitron Learning Repository**, where I document my complete journey through the **Foundations of Programming, Problem Solving, Competitive Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms** — module by module, class by class.

This repository represents my consistent learning path, practical coding exercises, and problem-solving growth throughout the Phitron course.


## Overview

Phitron is a structured, university-style programming course that focuses on building strong fundamentals in:
- ✅ **Programming Logic & Syntax**
- ✅ **Problem Solving & Competitive Programming**
- ✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- ✅ **Code Optimization & Complexity Analysis**
- ✅ **Real-world Implementation of Algorithmic Thinking**

This repository serves as my **digital notebook** — a public record of what I’ve learned and solved during my Phitron journey.
